        <item>Follow your passions, live your dreams. Do not become another engineer round the corner - A popular message that Bollywood and the Indian YouTube community keep feeding us every now and again. The idea is to not make a big deal out of academic excellence, and run in a predictable race to the top. As radical as it sounds, this article is here to argue against that idea, especially in the Indian context.

The crux of my argument lies in its entirety in one word. Population. There is no doubt that judging a person’s capabilities with respect to anything should be holistic, inclusive of many metrics. But this philosophy fails the moment you have to scale it to a gigantic size of millions. Unless we do reach the pinnacle of the digital era, where we have enough data to process and analyze the abilities of each of these millions of people, we have to rely on the metrics most easily available to us. Their grade sheets and their academic records. Even the best B schools of this country that boast of well-rounded leaders have no choice but to initiate their admission screening with a heavily competitive test. They will spend the entire year doing nothing but screening candidates otherwise.
And this is exactly why it becomes extremely important to drill this into our children’s heads. The reality of how brutal this race is. And making sure they give academic excellence and discipline ton loads of importance than the other western countries do.

But what if my children do not aspire to be management consultants, engineers, or doctors, you might say? Well, my argument remains the same. Population. You keep hearing stories of people who have dared the odds and won. But with history as our witness, we know that the stories that reach us are just the successful ones. 9 out of every 10 startups crash within the first two years of their birth. Every other street in our cities has an aspiring dancer, a dreamy youtuber and a struggling actor. The harsh reality is that the race is far more brutal there than it is academically. Now I really do not have a problem if you have the means and resources to get up from a failure to pick yourself back up. But this luxury isn’t with all of us. Some of us have dependent parents. And some of us need alternate sources of income to survive. And this income is hardly of any consequence if you aren’t academically qualified.

Nobody is asking you to never do what you love. The only ask is to make you realize that just like food, clothing, shelter, and now the internet, you need academic excellence as a safety net to survive. Because thanks to the sheer number of us alive, no matter what your passion is, the rat race is real.</item>
        <item>It can be conveniently assumed that you have either spent a lot of time standing in painfully long queues to withdraw money at least once by now, or dropped the idea of doing something you really wanted to, but couldn\'t because of the obvious cash crunch.

If my assumptions are right, then there cannot be a better argument against a decision that looked more like an impulsive child\'s tantrum, with no planning, estimation, or efficient cost benefit analysis whatsoever. Public inconvenience, for a cause that no one still seems to understand.

Like the opposition rightly mentioned in recent Parliament sessions, the government has put us through inconvenience in accessing our own hard earned cash, creating a financial anarchy. Even if I were to assume this move was worth the hype, it is more than obvious that its repercussions were hardly taken into account.

From small time merchandise and vegetable sellers in cities and towns, to textile industries in Varanasi, businesses are run by raising capital in the form of cash from lenders, selling product and making money, paying back the lender with interest from the money made, and generating profits from whatever is left. Ecosystems of these sort have come to a standstill with this demonetization. Cash liquidity has gone for a toss. If you had a tiring half day finding it tough to reach an ATM screen in your metro cities, then it is mindboggling to even imagine the pain rural India is going through, given they have one ATM for every 12.66 villages. The implementation mishap is not only driving the costs of the idea high, but the affected businesses will also drive costs of basic commodities high.

Now coming to the more disturbing part, are our sacrifices worth anything? It doesn’t look like it. Most black money is not in cash. And even if it were, the amount in cash can easily be converted into white through existing channels like gold sellers, charitable trusts and religious institutions. Hardly anything has been done with respect to ways of generating black money. So demonetization is nothing more than a temporary bottleneck to cash hoarders. What about counterfeit currency, you might say? Sadly, there isn\'t any improvement in technology of production of the new notes preventing counterfeiting.

From improved tax reforms, to policies that curb the flow of black money rather than just attacking currently hoarded piles, we have a long way to go to achieve what the government thinks it has achieved with this miniscule, yet annoying step.

All you can do now, is wait and see how this unfolds in the 50 days ahead of us, and keep praying it doesn’t get any worse.</item>
        <item>Social evils. Modern India sure knows how ridiculous they are, and is fighting to eradicate them. Maybe that is why we tend to forget, that not very long ago, these social evils were Indian traditions, followed religiously (pun intended). Now these Indian traditions did not start sounding ridiculous overnight. We took decades, sometimes centuries to get there.

A lot of credit for this change goes to the most powerful tool there is, education. Education helped us bring in that much needed awareness, to pull people out of their ignorance, and then enlighten them. However, there are those of us feudal aged retards on whom this tool is inapplicable, who choose to be ignorant, and blindly believe in what we grew up knowing. And precisely for those of us, we have a tool that does the exception handling. Law.

With anti-tradition and anti-superstition laws, we ‘force’ people out of ignorance. Fear wins where logic doesn’t, and this way, at least the generations to come will popularly believe that these traditions are ridiculous.

Now coming to this debate, isn’t banning religious symbols in public similar to those laws that are meant to slay superstition? It might not have been implemented flawlessly, but what France tried to do by banning symbols and burkinis (full body covering swim suits generally worn by Muslim women) was exactly that.

Secular ideology, like any other awareness campaign, needs laws to prevail. These laws undoubtedly need to loosen up a bit when people do something by pure choice. Say, for instance, I wear a t-shirt that has the syllable “om” printed all over it. If I am sporting that t-shirt shirt as a fashion accessory, I should be totally allowed to wear it. The very same holds for any woman who goes to a beach. If she is a shy person, and does not like wearing revealing clothes, she should be allowed to wear a spacesuit for all I care. But if she wears something out of compulsion, only because she is born as a woman of that religion, or if she somehow believes that she will be punished if she wears anything other than this, or believes that this is the only attire a woman like her deserves, then you sure as hell know that we need those laws.

France has taken on something very bold and brave (very befitting of the French). Their government believes that if we were schooled in uniforms to eliminate distinction between kids coming from different communities or stratus of society and promote a sense of togetherness, then why aren’t we doing anything similar with our society.

Their intentions are right. However, the major hurdle they will face is the sensitivity of the issue, of how it can arguably look like they are trying to snatch away the very Freedom of Expression they want people to have. There is only one way their government can be victorious. They need to give it time, and loosen up a bit, but so do the citizens of France.</item>
        <item>Freedom of expression – an easily abused tool, and yet, a life essential. A world without it wouldn’t be anywhere close to the word liberal. The internet does it’s bit to strengthen that tool. Although the pain of dealing with tons of nonsense is evident, social media sure has empowered each and every single one of us to voice our opinions. Now the opinion might be highly hostile, or plain rubbish, but it still is a valid opinion.


But how much can social media opinions actually translate to expressing our views everywhere? A strong and much needed movement like feminism cannot remain floating on the internet, with a few likes and shares. This movement has to reflect in the things we do, the tiny, day-to-day things. And that is where fashion steps in.

Fashion is the strongest mode of Freedom of Expression there is. I do not know if fashion aids feminism, but I know that it sure as hell can. We unarguably possess sexist opinions on a whole lot of things, but mind you, these sexist opinions do not exist because of fashion; they are voiced out because of fashion. They are voiced out because of the world’s resistance to change, along with that sexism drilled into us, consciously and subconsciously over centuries. And the only way to change it is to bring in more of that fashion. Wearing what you like isn’t just about a matter of convenience. It is an attitude in itself. It makes you the owner of your doings, the king of your choices. And the more each of us does it, the more it becomes common. And one day, it becomes so common that we are subconsciously tuned to be equals. (I hope it doesn’t take centuries to happen though)

The point is driven home clearer if you look at fashion as an industry. Look closely, and you will see that it is a feminist movement in itself. There is no other equally progressive industry that open heartedly welcomes trans-genders or homosexuals to work without discrimination from the rest. Beyond the size zero dolls, it is a culmination of expressive art, worked upon together by people of all kinds.

Now let’s address the tricky part. The fashion industry wants to stay progressive, address and advocate India’s strong independent women. But just like Bollywood, they stand divided. It is shocking to note that this industry till date makes most of its money from bridal wear. And even the most daring designers are stuck to idolizing the obedient bride for the money. This isn’t something I can provide a solution to in my one tiny conclusive paragraph. It is something all us have to do. Sure change happens reluctantly with a lot of resistance. Sure the world is lazy, judgmental, and tough to convince. But before you step out to convince the world, convince yourself. Begin that movement against resistance within yourself. Fashion ‘can’ aid feminism, but only if you want it to</item>
        <item>Gender inequality is real. Social stigma is real. Violation of human rights is real. And all of this isn’t real in some far off rural land away from civilization. It is real where you live, in your city, at your home.
When a friend of mine told his mother that he had a girlfriend, these were her first words, “I can’t do anything about it because it’s you, but if your sister gets inspired by you and gets a boyfriend, I am going to break her legs.” Patriarchy isn’t just ingrained into the heads of men from tier 2 cities and villages who are aloof about consent or marital rape, it is ingrained into each and every one of us.

I do not want movies to bring in revolution, to change how each and every one of us thinks, or to achieve ridiculously impossible things like ending the entire nation’s corruption in a day. I want them to give us moments; tiny moments of introspection. Moments that make a father feel guilty for shouting at his daughter the other day for coming home late, that make a woman feel terrible for judging her daughter-in-law on the mere basis of the length of her clothes, that make your neighbors more welcoming to your ways of living.

Some of my parents’ friends think eating non-vegetarian is a terrible thing to do, then when will a person (boy or girl) who drinks or smokes ever be less than a criminal to them? If a movie like this can even change one person and stop them from misjudging another’s personal choices as wrong doing, then I will believe that we have inspired change.

Pink does exactly that. It is not here to magically solve every woman’s problems. It isn’t here to make men beyond hope understand the value of equality. And maybe it isn’t here to bring in change, but it surely is here to inspire some. Parts of monologues of that powerful movie pinched my soul for the sexist wrong-doings I had consciously and sub-consciously done so far.

One thing is pretty clear from all this. The trickle down mechanism isn’t what is actually failing. The trickle down never even started. Even the first layer this awareness is supposed to seep through isn’t thoroughly done. And this undoubtedly is all the more reason why we need more cinema like this.</item>
        <item>David Howell Petraeus is a retired American officer. Before becoming the Director of CIA in September 2011, he was a highly decorated General. In 2012, he resigned from his post as the Director of CIA, citing an extra marital affair that had come to light in an FBI investigation. His retirement sparked a heated debate about the importance of private life of a public figure.

Did his affair discredit all the accolades that he had won as an army general and as the CIA director? Absolutely not. Then why did he have to resign? The answer is tied to the nature if his job. He was the leader of an organization that trains them to avoid doing anything that can expose them to blackmail. And his affair compromised his ability to lead such an organization.

Now this is a very specific scenario that deals with the security of a nation, and makes it all the more easier to justify looking into the leader’s private life. But let’s look at a broader scenario. Why does the private or family life of a leader matter to us?

It matters to us, because it all comes down to trustworthiness, the most important quality that people seek in a leader. And if a person cannot uphold the trust of his/her spouse, how can the general public trust him/her. When a person gets married, he vows to honor his relationship with his wife in front of a community of friends and relatives. Similarly, when an officer is pledged into public office, he takes an oath to honor his position and office in front of a community of friends and colleagues. Then why should the vows of marriage not be a factor in the calculation of his character?

Now don\'t get me wrong. I am not saying that leaders should be judged by their sexual orientation or their dressing sense. I only care about a leader\'s private life if it speaks of his character. If a person cares about his family and holds the virtues of kindness and love, maybe he would be more careful in giving orders to assassinate innocent civilians during war. After all, we are humans and not robots. How different can our thought process and behavior be in our personal and professional lives? It’s the same mind, same heart and same ethics. Can someone really be a terrible person in the private sphere and a great person on the public front?

That said, we would obviously prefer a sensible leader with a messy family life over a feather-brained person with a sorted family life. We cannot discredit all the good work done by someone and brand him as a playboy just because one of his affairs came to light. Every leader is a human and humans are fallible.

All am asking for is when an equation is drawn to judge the credibility of a leader, one of the variables in the equation be his public vows to honor his private life. Because the true test of a man\'s character is what he does when no one is watching.</item>
        <item>Any Indian who has ever taken a bank loan knows the horrendous power of compounding interests. Something very similar happens with taxation on goods and services in India before the product reaches the consumer. An effect thats called the cascading of taxes. In layman terms, taxes on taxes on taxes.

This way taxation bundles up at each transactional level of a particular product. Now India, like any other sensible developed nation, has finally taken the most logical step to deal with this messy way of taxation. Unifying it all under one roof, the Goods and Services Tax (GST).

Replacement of our multi-layered taxation system with GST erases the vast number of blind-spots people capitalize on through corruption at each layer. It single-handedly makes businesses more transparent and accountable.

Though the consumer pays a unified tax (on goods and services alike), this tax is levied together by the Central and the State governments (equally in all probability), so the states dont fail at making healthy tax revenues either. And since the burden of taxation will equally be shared by goods and services, it might make services more expensive than they currently are in the short term, but it drastically reduces prices at which we buy goods. And this proportionately increases our consumption. As Indias net consumption rises, so does the need for better goods and services, thereby opening up new markets to explore. Eventual industrial competitiveness will bring down the prices of services as well in the long run.

A heavy increase in goods consumption, and a check on black money and corruption translate to one powerful result: a substantial growth in Indias GDP. In layman terms, this is an indicator of how well the Indian economy is doing, and what our standard of living is.

The bill smoothly turns the whole of India into one single market. This saves a lot of inter-state businesses a lot of time and effort spent on paperwork. All they will now have to do is to centrally register once, and forget the hassles of the past. Companies will now be able to establish their manufacturing plants in locations all over the country with relative ease, thereby improving their distribution networks. Also, these companies can now actively target competitive exports

This scheme of taxation, as stated above, is advantageous to the government (more revenue for States, and easy regulatory tax monitoring for the Center. Did I mention corruption check), to companies (ease of cross border business between States, less burdening of taxation, and healthy growth opportunities), to the economy (not going over the GDP explanation again and boring you), and finally to you, the dearest consumer.

You will all thank the heavens for GST when it helps vanish those 1 and 0.5 taxes like the Swacch Bharat and Krishi Kalyan cess charges from your bills. They will technically still be in effect, but atleast will not boil your blood as you look at those unnecessary long bills at restaurants before you make that exit.

India’s message is loud and clear.

        <item>he basic argument around surge pricing has always remained the same - How can someone charge higher for a service during high demand when the same service is available at lower price during other times of the day? Certainly there is no value add that the company is doing in the service to charge such a high price.
Well, the easiest answer to that question lies in the simple supply-demand concept of economics. When the demand increases, and supply remains constant, the price of the service increases. This kind of Dynamic/Surge pricing is not new to India or Indians. Try booking flight tickets to your hometown a day before Diwali. You already have the answer. If other services can do it, then why not cab aggregators.

Half a decade ago, cab services like Meru would have charged you a bomb for their rides. This is what gave the founders of these cab aggregators an idea. An idea to bring down that price, but making sure that they remain sustainable and generate similar revenues by increasing the number of rides they offer per day, essentially spreading that huge margin across multiple rides now.

But to increase the number of rides, a customer has to choose ‘on the spot’ cabs instead of his previous modes of transport. Now the only way he would that is if he knew this service was reliable, even in cases of emergency. In a world without surge pricing, a person heading to a mall and another to the airport would be treated no differently. Assuming both of them are in the same area, and there is only one cab available, the cab gets booked on a first come first served basis, thus failing the customer who needs it in his emergency. But if there was surge pricing, the person heading to the mall would wait to book his cab when the prices come down, the person who has a flight to catch will have his emergency addressed with a slightly higher fare, given his constraint of time. And since there is surge, idle drivers of other areas are notified of the supply need here, and they will move in here, and the other person can now get his cab too at a fair price (Now that prices are down again with the inflow of supply to this area).

So it is wrong to say that cab aggregators don’t add any value while charging you higher. The reliability is their value add. Further, in today’s fast paced world, time has become a much higher priced resource than currency and hence it becomes important that such services bring that element into their pricing as well. However, reliability is such an intangible part of the service that most people fail to appreciate or notice it.

Look at it from a driver’s perspective. Most of these aggregators make sure about 80% of the revenue generated goes to the drivers, even during surge pricing. A chance for them to live wealthier and more comfortable lives. This army of entrepreneurs can aim at better livelihood, and providing better reliable services.

Once we accept the tenet of surge pricing, the next question is how much to surge. It’s imperative that companies don’t take advantage of ‘Surge Pricing’ to charge higher from customers. Hence, a regulation framework would help in creative a conducive eco-system for both players. However, these regulations need to be progressive keeping abreast with technological progress and demands of a business. This requires collaboration between government and cab aggregators since both of them are still learning. A standoff among these players based on half cooked rules and technology inhibiting regulations (As recently seen in Karnataka) would neither support the business nor solve the acute transportation problem that we face today.</item>
        <item>Inspiring tales, controversial exchanges, and grueling contests. American politics has given us a lot in the last couple of centuries. Come this November, it is ready to surprise us yet again, with a woman finally having her name on the Presidential ticket of a leading party. A woman, who comes from an age where women were not expected to have any professional aspirations, let alone political ones. Back then, a young girl named Hillary Rhodam Clinton had ventured to stand for the post of Class President in high school, a position that had been held only by men. She is attempting something similar again, just the stakes are much higher this time around.

In the entire Presidential debate, the comments of an ex CIA director, Michael Morell, where he unabashedly expresses why he would choose Hilary Clinton over Donald trump any day, is something that should definitely interest you before you take that call. Firstly, he trusts her to deliver on the most important duty of a Commander-In-Chief, keeping the nation safe. And secondly, he feels Donald Trump might pose a threat to national security.

Let us dwell deeper into Morell’s first statement. Can Hillary Clinton deliver on the duties of a President, or rather, \"Is Hillary Clinton qualified to be a President?\" The answer is a straightforward, resonating YES. She is a smart, Yale educated woman, who has been the first Lady for 8 years, is a former US Senator for New York  the ex Secretary of State; and has worked for causes that matter. Through all these she has exhibited that she knows a thing or two about foreign policy, can be a pragmatic decision maker and does care about the American people. All qualities that would make for an acceptable President.

But when people were asked to describe her, all they could say was \"she is a good choice\". American citizens were unable to associate any leadership qualities with her, primarily because she hasn\'t gained much \"trustworthiness\", thanks to her private email server scandal, and her reaction on issues related to Bill Clinton’s alleged affairs. It’s also quite possible that her lack of great oratory skills keeps her from appealing to people, especially because our society expects the voice of a woman in power to be soft yet confident, and display both care and authority at the same time. The fact that she is a centrist on so many issues hurts her reputation, more often than not. Though she is garnering support from both Democrats and Republicans, neither community is able to relate to her completely.

Whatever the concerns might be, one thing is pretty damn clear. She is much better than her opponent, Donald J Trump. Which brings us to the second point made by Morell. Are we choosing Hillary Clinton for the fear of being led by Trump (or for the desire of getting Bill Clinton back in the White House)? Or do we really see a leader in Hillary? Is she just running as an alternative to Trump or does she really want to make a difference in the lives of people? These are the real questions we should be seeking answers to. Because between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, the latter is clearly the lesser of two evils.</item>
        <item>\"The best argument against democracy is a five-minute conversation with the average voter\" - Winston Churchill.

Before the shortcomings of democracy are discussed, the first and foremost idea we have to force ourselves to accept is that no form of governance is perfect. Perfection doesn\'t exist; we only illude ourselves with the lie that somewhere is the \'perfectness\' we are all aiming at.

Democracy is the most popular form of governance today. With over 123 democracies among 192 nations, one could argue that had there been any serious flaw with democracy, it would not have this level of acceptance. Therein lies one of the biggest shortcomings of democracy- The mob mentality.

Let us ignore, for a moment, the extreme fallacies of democratic governments that history offers us. It is important to understand the root cause before we go onto examples. Mobs are easily manipulated. Mob justice is emotional and impulsive. Mob wisdom is conventional wisdom – easy, pleasing and short-sighted. In a utopia where individuals do not succumb to peer pressure, where logic is given priority over emotion, where the intelligent commoner\'s voice is heard over the mob\'s noise, democracy would triumph.

Sadly, ours isn\'t a utopia. Our Mobs are disinclined towards change. Given the choice, we choose to ignore a discomfort, rather than work for a solution. The racism, the popularity of Trump campaign, our denial of global warming and so on. Simply put general populace is equivalent to a child – easily manipulated, fickle , violent and self-righteous.

Democracy gave the world the notorious dictator, Adolph Hitler. Germany was at the receiving end of all the allied nations\' anger, so the strong and charismatic Hitler\'s rise to the rule is not surprising. The Russian revolution in the early 20th century gave the soviet union The Kerensky Provisional Government; an utter failure. Vladimir Putin\'s rule in Russia, Indira Gandhi\'s imposed emergency in India in 1975 still stain ugly blots on democracy.

One might argue that crowds in developed nations couldn\'t possibly be wrong. Brexit is the metaphorical blow in the face of that argument. Granted, David Cameron can be blamed for not convincing his party opposing Brexit and the lack of proper publicity for his cause, Brexit is the perfect example of why general populace cannot be trusted to make important decisions. Not everyone is an economics expert. So, it all comes down to which movement has the most charming figurehead.

Ignoring the blatant influence of oratory skills and publicity on mob\'s decision, the reports of people voting for Brexit simply \'because everyone else did\' or \'my vote doesn\'t matter anyway\' are disturbing, because they show, no matter the enlightenment campaigns, the sheep mentality isn\'t going to change.

No matter the situation, democracy, in the end, boils down to a glorified popularity contest.</item>

The only question that still stings, burns and hurts, is it all worth it? Is academic excellence really worth the pain and the pressure that kids endure to achieve it.

We all related to the autistic artist we saw in Darsheel Safary. We knew that the very autistic kid who struggles with academics, could one day be counted amongst greats, one among Sachin Tendulkar, who barely studied till his tenth, or Steve Jobs, our idolized college drop out. Then why do we forget all this time and again as parents?

The answers lie in our upbringing. Upbringing, especially in the ever so classic setting of the aspiring middle class Indian families. Right from childhood, the main idea ingrained deep into our heads and hearts is that we need to land jobs that can pay the bills. And our adults know that the only thing that can get us these jobs is shining report cards. That’s where we start falling into the trap, the trap of academic excellence. From the basic need of passing all classes to get a job, this trap evolves to being brilliant in all subjects to land a good college admission, then being brilliant there to land a good job, then being brilliant at the job henceforth to land a good spouse and then, pass on the same to our kids. Boom. Before you know it, the vicious cycle of a trap has engulfed you and everyone around you. The need for academic excellence slowly becomes so dreary, that on it comes to depend our position in the society. The pressure to do well lands so hard on a child that sometimes he, as is very aptly conveyed in a dialogue of \'3 Idiots\', considers it easier to kill himself than to fail an exam and be shamed in the society.

What this competitive society also does is disregard anyone incompetent as unworthy of befriending. Our success in academic excellence makes us blind to others’ failures. Needless to say, it’s a horrible trait that kills our empathetic qualities. We need to realize that singularly focused education restricts the perspective of the kids. Its akin to covering the eyes of a horse with blinkers, because you want them to see just in one direction.

In this race to achieve academic excellence, kids sometimes lose their innocent childhood in tuitions and coaching classes, sometimes their self confidence in constant comparisons to the colloquial \'Mr Sharma\'s son\' and in rare cases their lives for the fear of failure. But more often than not, kids lose out on a wholesome education, an education that teaches them to respect all people irrespective of their gender, cast, race or religion; an education that teaches them that to treat failure as a stepping stone for success; an education that teaches them to be good human beings before being a good engineer, doctor or a scientist.

Which brings me to my bottom-line. We are the ones who tuned the world to run on report cards. Now we can either train our kids to become a part of the current system, or we can teach them to change the system. We can teach them that life exists beyond report cards. The choice is wholly upto you though.</item>
        <item>I have been through the grind of standing in a long ATM queue. I have seen and experienced the decision’s appalling infrastructural flaws for myself, and heard enough of how ineffective the idea will eventually pan out to be.

But on the other hand, there is a gutsy Prime Minister asking me give him roughly 50 days’ time to prove how this move can give results, and how it’s much more than an act of stupidity done with the right intention. I know, that 50 days later, I won’t buy whatever I am told, and I most certainly won’t make my own conclusions without expert opinion. I might even dismiss the entire idea and fight against it, or fight for its better implementation. But until then, I will give this hyped, stirring move a chance.

As inconvenient and annoying as this idea is, it is giving way to something this nation would inherently never do. Going cashless, and being cool with it. Vendors who can afford to, are quickly moving to accepting cards for payment, and small time vegetable sellers are finding ways like QR code scans (for e wallet money transfers) to keep their businesses afloat. Millions of Indians are migrating to banking and electronic payments as a result of this. Bill Gates calls this move a step towards greater transparent economy, and how this could also be the necessary propellant in making India the world’s largest digitized economy.

There is but another peculiar advantage that rises out of this current situation. An article on Scroll.in by Girish Shahane comments on how this move is leading to a “massive transfer of wealth from the affluent to the less well off”. The less well-off will help the influential rich launder money by depositing the rich’s unaccounted cash into their own accounts, and giving it back to them later by charging a fee. The government is also bound to make money that will be paid as dividends to it by the RBI, if a lot of this demonetized currency fails to make it back to the central bank within stipulated time.

We certainly have a long way to go. One whimsical announcement is obviously not going to eradicate illegal ways of generating money, but it is also obvious that, for once, those who generate this illegal money have felt some kind of heat. They know now that this government can do radically random things, and can affect them in more ways going further ahead. That way, this sure is a baby step in doing some kind of damage to the so called ‘cash hoarders’.

I am in no love with the idea. The idea is far from perfect or pleasant, but it sure is revolutionary and helping us in some ways. Do raise your voice once things go out of control, or look like they are going to, but until then, buy loads of popcorn, stack up necessary cash at home from ATMs near buy, sit back, and wait for the rest of the story to unfold.</item>
        <item>I wore spectacles for 13 years, starting from when I was 8. After I got an eye surgery done and saw my face in the mirror for the first time, I could not relate to the person staring back at me.   This is exactly what a Sikh soldier said after getting admitted into the US military, not about the spectacles obviously, but that he could not relate to his reflection without the turban and the beard. For a person who has grown up wearing a veil in public areas, or the African head wrap, or a beard; all those items are as much a part of their identity as my spectacles were a part of mine. And I wouldn\'t have liked it a single bit for the government to ban spectacles.

But what if I was made to wear spectacles to oppress me in some manner (say to never let me look pretty and save me from the glances of evil male gender). I could have gone through my whole life without knowing that spectacles are a choice and not a way of life. In that case would banning them have helped empower me? I don\'t think so, I think what empowered me to let them go was the knowledge that an alternate way existed to help me see the world. So that I could take my time to embrace the new ways of seeing. After all empowerment is giving someone the power to choose.

Women cannot be empowered by forcing them to let go of burqa, just like they cannot be empowered by forcing them to wear one. Educate them, especially the younger ones, so that they can understand there is no need for them to cover their face when they walk out in public. If strict rules are required to make sure their parents don\'t force them to wear burqas, then apply them with an age consideration. But don\'t strip a 50 year old woman from something that has become part of her identity.

We live in a society that boasts of freedom of expression, and included in this freedom is every individual\'s right to use symbols of faith as a form of religious expression. On some level, banning the religious symbols cab be possibly equated to a violation of basic human rights. And on what grounds are these religious or cultural symbols being discouraged/banned in public? To help prevent a divide based on religion, race or region. Think about this, if our behavior towards a person is affected by whether someone is clean shaven or bearded, wearing a swim suit or a burkini; then it is also affected by whether someone is driving a BMW or a Maruti 800. When we are banning religious symbols in public to promote togetherness, let\'s ban premier cars and exclusive clothing in the same breath?

But before we ban one or all of these things, let\'s take a moment to think about the kind of superficial secularism that we are promoting where people cannot look beyond a burqa, a turban or a BMW. Ignorance of a person\'s religion is not secularism, the ability to look beyond religion is. Because such a superficial sense of togetherness will always find some or the other way for differential treatment, if not religious, then racial.

Our methods of togetherness should not be a struggle for a Muslim woman to get onto the streets of France, or for a Sikh boy to get enrolled in the US military.</item>
        <item>Feminism is the latest, and at least in principle perhaps the most needed fashion right now. Anyone with an internet connection and a passable knowledge of English knows what feminism is, and how important the movement is. Despite the importance, the criticisms on the modern day feminists are endless, and some of them are perhaps not undeserved. This article doesn\'t concern itself with the shortcomings of the feminist movement.

Though not imminently noticeable, the way the fashion changes through the time weaves an imminently important story. The rise of jeans tells the tale of growth in the polymer industry and the increasingly busy schedules of the youth. Similarly, a substantial change in fashion can instill confidence, propel minds to change and subtly alter public opinion. The ‘matter of fact’ quotes on the tees, the shift in the pattern of body parts exposed, or the parts put on spotlight - a change in fashion, like a change in pop culture, is something that has a much deeper cause.

Hence it is very easy to assume, that as a tool, fashion can boost feminism into new heights. And indeed, countless examples from the past and many contemporary trends reflect the fact. But what most people chose to ignore, is that fashion is a tool, just as anything influential is. And the skill with which it is yielded is what determines whether the overall effect suits the needs of the moment.

This is the era of internet, and it had never been easier to enflame a spark into a bang. A trend/fashion innocently favoring feminism could easily go viral, thanks to the internet. And countless people, with diverse mindsets and opinions, get inspired by the trend and create their own trends to suit their thoughts. In no time, the trends apparently inspired from the favorable one, are so disparate and different from the source, one would have to wonder if they can be called feminist fashion anymore. While the increased innovative input would undoubtedly result in a few trends that are better than the original, it can be assumed easily, that many inspired trends cater to the extremists and worse, masquerading as feminist fashion. That causes a lot more damage than any beneficiaries the original trend resulted in.

This is, of course, just an assumption. It could be argued that a strong leader figure could set the trend to its rights. Well, it is obvious that feminism has no overwhelmingly strong leading figures. Also, Feminism is notoriously famous for its extremist side, popularly termed feminazis who masquerade their own agenda under the feminist flag. Hence it shouldn\'t come out as a surprise that some feminist fashion trends are infamous for the discomfort and irritation they produce in the general populace. For what it\'s worth, feminist fashion -for the lack of better word-sabotages itself.

One fact should be made clear, though, it\'s not just fashion that can potentially hinder its mother moment. When a movement lacks proper vision, any tool made available to the followers has the potential to sabotage its very purpose. The bottom line. Feminism as a movement is yet to find more definition. It is scattered, and haphazardly driven. And if powerful idea like feminism isn’t properly propagated, tools like fashion that its meant to use would damage the cause than rather help it.</item>
        <item>The motion is pretty straightforward. Movies like Pink do not inspire change, because the people it is meant to change will never even watch it. And even if they do, it will be a delightful experience of mockery for them, as they will tear apart the movie’s essence with their nasty comments, and as a bonus, ruin the movie for you too.

Let’s tackle this statistically. Only a third of India’s population lives in urban areas. Most producers who make movies with strong social messages aren’t fortunate enough to have the power, money or connections required to distribute their movie’s prints pan India. This can mean only one thing. The movie becomes a typical multiplex-screening-only affair.

So forget about two thirds of this country even thinking of watching this movie. In all probability, if the movie has no promotional songs that might be accessible to them via television or radio, they wouldn’t even know it exists.

Only those out of the other one third who are fortunate enough to be able to afford a movie ticket at a multiplex, will have the luxury of watching it. And the only group these minuscule bunch of movie watchers can share their review with, is an even tinier social media population. And that is where most of my worry resides.

Impeccable production houses like TVF have made revolutionary web shows like ‘Permanent Roommates’, a show that fearlessly discusses live-in relationships, pre-marital sex, and pregnancy before marriage, without the stigma around it. But 80% of India’s serial watching population still relies on television, where manifestation of concepts like this show will take longer than Elon Musk helping us reach Mars.

Since the percolation to a wider audience is this slow, whatever percolation of movies like this does happen, it is undignified for not being entertaining enough, and for spewing man-hatred. And you know how bad it is when an independent woman, a corporate lawyer, writes hurtfully that her movie watching experience with ‘Pink” was a disaster in a tier 2 Indian city. With patriarchy ingrained into their heads, men inside the theater did not let her watch the movie in peace as they rambled on about how the girls in the movie deserved the torture they went through, along with threatening her to keep her mouth shut when she tried to stop them.

Our society is still divided. The way we are trying to trickle down awareness is what is actually failing us. Cinema is failing us. But it shouldn’t be the case forever. I might not have the entire solution to the problem. But I do have a valuable suggestion. I believe that society is heavily moved forward by comedy. Look at how the show ‘Friends’ made the current generation of Indian youth progressive, or look at how 3 idiots carefully blended comedy with flaws in our education system. As a theater artist, I strongly believe in making people laugh, cry, and then think. With gradual steps of taking internet to every single one of us, and popularizing content like this, with healthy investments for distribution going into them too, one these days, we will make a bigger difference.

But for now, we are just not there yet.</item>
        <item>Before I even start building my arguments, I am going to narrow down the scope of this topic without any hesitation, because we are making the debate pretty vague by calling it a leader’s ‘private life’. What we truly care is about his or her sex life. It doesn’t matter to us if the leader has unhygienic habits, or doesn’t treat his dog well. We are all busy peeping into his bedroom window to see who he sleeps with, and how.

Now why does this matter? It matters because the discussion is no more about the holistic view of a person, it is all about just one particular aspect that is falsely being looked at as the big picture. We are imperfect creatures, and it is our flaws, and our heart to look beyond these flaws that makes us human. But unfortunately, we shamelessly forget about it when it comes to our favorite fictional characters, or public figures. And unfortunately still, public figures are more human than these fictional characters, so the disappointment they cause is ominous.

Why is it okay for us to be flawed but not our leaders, and why does it have to be with this one aspect? Give it a good thought. You don’t want your boss to ask you to forego a promotion because you unreasonably shouted at your wife the other day (unless your wife is your boss, in which case, may God save you). If you are okay being imperfect, and believe our leaders are as human as we are and can empathize with us, then you should treat them the same way too. Let them be imperfect in aspects where your interference hardly matters.

Let me strengthen my argument by asking you to perform a simple comparison. Given you have to choose among two leaders, one who has taken faulty decisions that have dearly costed his organization and has a flawless marital life, and another with only the word success written all over his track record, but with three alleged (Please do focus on the word ‘alleged’, and how we blindly believe allegations to be true too) affairs. Undoubtedly, sense will only prevail if you choose the latter.

The most common argument against leaders with wrecked private lives is that they aren’t robots and cannot keep their public and private mutually exclusive, and will eventually affect their work lives as well. I say you are just looking at it from the wrong side. We have been consistently prepped up at our workplaces with pep talks about professionalism, that ask us to deliver productively even if we have personal headaches to deal with.  So if our leader truly is a professional, then robot or not (him having a wrecked private life already proves he isn’t), he will never disappoint us ‘professionally’. His true strength will lie in treating these two independently, and reassuring us of flawless governance despite this personal turmoil. And if he does fail, we all know way too well how that’s going to end up for him.

Let me rest my case by citing my own example. I am a theater artist. When I am on stage, all that matters is how I play my role. Who I am when no one is watching is none of your business. As long as the leader knows his role, and delivers what he stands for, keep your curious eyes away from his bedroom.</item>
        <item>It will only take you a couple of minutes to check how exceedingly well most GST implementing nations have done in the long run. It is an undeniable trend, that unequivocally proves how GST is a better scheme of taxation, despite its shortcomings.

Then why even have this debate in the first place? My argument isn’t about GST being good or not. It is about whether we are ready for it. Owing to various constraints (including the functionality of the Indian constitution), a bill that has been constantly proposed since 2004 was brought to limelight by Arun Jaitley in 2014, and will be brought to life three years hence, in April 2017. Compared to the other innumerable proposals, the traction that this bill has seen over the last few years is commendable. But is it enough? Because if the fastest we took to reach here is three years, then will we be able to proactively amend the bill, as we face tons of critical and cynical feedback next year, once the bill is underway?

 While the bill needed only 15 out of 29 votes (one for each state) to pass, it got a convincing number of 17 votes. But again, is it enough? Will the remaining 12 ever be happy with this decision. And the fight isn’t over. As the GST council gets together to decide how much it should finally tax the consumer, will all States unanimously ever agree? Are we ready for the unrest, this one big leap-of-faith kind of a decision, is to bring to us?


The bill needs a seamless portal, that scales equally nicely for individuals as well as companies across the country. The transparency of taxation that we are rooting for will hold no value if we don’t make this portal robust and secure, to make sure it does not leak or lose data.


And of course, as rosy as the idea seems, the initial phase of GST’s implementation will unavoidably result in a spike in inflation, majorly because services will suddenly get more expensive. The GST is a novel idea in the long run, but this long run performance heavily depends on the trust we show in the jittery phases of the idea. The goods most consumers buy on a regular basis are generally inexpensive and a drop in their prices will hardly impact their quantities of consumption. However, we do regularly avail services for food and travel, and a sudden spike there, though still affordable, will psychologically tarnish the image of GST in our heads. Will we support an idea like this even in that situation, given that we brought a metro city like Bengaluru to a painful halt over an unending water dispute, and dissatisfaction with the apex court’s decision?


It would be totally unfair to disregard the efforts put in by many to make this idea a reality by being pessimistic about it. I don’t want the GST to be stalled. I just want you to give it a thought. To just consider that before we eliminate our multi-layered model of taxation and bring in GST, maybe we need to eliminate the gaps in our ways of functioning and thinking. The GST will desperately need both to survive and win.</item>
        <item>The last decade well and truly symbolizes the proliferation of technology. Many companies have ridden on this crest of technology to influence our lifestyles. This phenomenon cannot be better encapsulated, than by Uber, the company that has disrupted many a verticals and revolutionized the way people travel. The convenience of summoning a ride to your doorstep has become a norm in the same household where taking a cab was a luxury few years back. Uber has successfully and deservedly captured the biggest markets across the globe and is striving each day to sustain this unprecedented growth. While the affordable prices and comfortable rides have brought smiles to plenty of faces, the frown at the so-called “dynamic pricing” puts a blemish on their reputation.

Uber has forever defended surge pricing using the economics of the market; raised fares would act as incentives for drivers, thereby meeting the demand for the flourish of customers. However, the bigger problem to be addressed is the deep-rooted fallacies in its business model, something it has been unable to stabilize in the last few years. The tremendous spending of their funding on capturing market share and onboarding drivers has caused a huge financial pressure and it is struggling to make profits in most countries. The design of their algorithm ensures that a spike in the local demand enforces a surge price to attract more drivers on the streets, which in essence forces the rider to pay not just for the service but also to incentivize the drivers.

Over a period of time, the drivers have gamed the system as they wait for surge to apply before acknowledging their availability. While it’s a win-win for the driver and company, it leaves a huge hole in the customer\'s pocket. The very fact that the same set of areas have surge pricing every day and at similar times shows that Uber is not taking enough efforts to create a sustainable supply in those locations. There will surely be a day when the riders will be reluctant to pay for getting more drivers on the road and switch to an alternate mode of transport. I am certain that with the arsenal of technology that Uber possesses, it can predict these sudden bursts of demand and take preemptive actions.

Dynamic pricing also disrupts the regularity in many customers’ lives. A ride from the same source for the same destination may cost different at different times of the day and of the week. On days when the customer has to pay exorbitantly more, he or she feels cheated and wonders whether the money paid is worth the service that the company is providing. The ugly incident at Sydney where Uber enforced surge pricing during a hostage crisis and the case where a woman had to shell out over $360 for a cab ride are testament to the madness that dynamic pricing can create. The company and the driver\'s should most certainly not profit on the backs of people\'s misery and helplessness. In the quest of balancing demand and supply, Uber has ended up gouging many customers and I am sure it has lost a lot of loyalists along the way.

While it is true many other industries use dynamic pricing, but the frequency of touch points that Uber has in an individual\'s life is far greater than any other service out there. The very reason that people switched to Uber was to club convenience with relative low cost, but surge pricing is slowly yet surely cannibalizing their own USP and product. Uber must have a stern look at their dynamic policy to ensure that they don\'t lose customers at the cost of attracting more cars. Their recent merger in China shows that no company is bigger than the customers and they must strive to serve the interests of the riders. Being the Goliath it is, Uber must reform its pricing model to keep growing in developing countries else there are many just waiting to knock Uber off its perch.</item>
        <item>Everything isn\'t rocket science. But unfortunately, understanding the human nature is. That is how peculiarly we function. We sympathize with victims by emitting an aura of humanity and feeling kinship with everyone who falls under it.

We seek similarities to justify sympathy, but when the resemblances start blurring out, we conveniently replace this sympathy for the oppressed, with poisonously shared apathy for the \'apparent\' oppressors, if not illogical hatred. And that is why Donald John Trump, the multi-billionaire republican candidate for the president of USA is as famous as he is.

Anyone not living under a rock for the past year or so knows who Donald Trump is. It would not be an understatement to say that he single-handedly made American presidential elections mainstream on the Internet. He had been at the receiving end of staunch criticism and mockery from countless media outlets, Internet bloggers, celebrities and political experts since the start of his campaign. Also, He is the Republican Party candidate for the President of USA.

So, unless one assumes Donald Trump is a mind-bending mutant, the question remains as to why he is so popular.

Like every answer, this one is quite simple. Mr. Trump is a populist. Donald Trump appeals to the primal part of his audience. He speaks things no one dares to, and speaks them not dismally. Instead, he riots his audience to feel the way he wants them to. His wisdom is conventional, his solutions flashy, which he covers up with buster and charisma. He speaks what his audience wants to hear. Consider, for instance, his stance on immigration and Muslims. Like said earlier, many people do not show sympathy to someone who are so seemingly dissimilar. The general opinion of many Americans is that the most terrorists are Muslims and that all immigrants seeking asylum in America are fugitives, and that they steal most of the American jobs. Trump fueling their paranoia with countless accusations and basing his rather infamous policies on their fears is a huge reason why he is so popular.

Simply put, some of his policies are ridiculous at best and devastating at worst. The most infamous of his policies is the \'Mexico wall\' -to keep out illegal immigrants- funds for which he intends to demand from Mexico itself. Ignoring the preposterous alienating of its ally, the cost for building, maintaining and manning the wall should be enough to shoot down the idea as senseless. His foreign policy is best described as terrifying. Diplomacy is a wonderful art, and it involves certain amounts of compromise. Mr. Trump’s “America-First” policy would be disastrous in a world where the US is no longer miles ahead of every other country. Not to forget, his ignorance of contemporary international relations is astounding. The lack of support from his own party is alarming and might be indicative of a divided government in his presidency.

Donald Trump is also considered by many as racist and as a hypocrite. His comments on immigrants, Muslims, and Mexicans are racist. Him calling Muslims terrorists and enemies of America and then making deals with other Muslims, him bashing others for investing overseas while comfortably ignoring his company\'s investments are duplicitous. His stances on various issues are unreliable, and can best be considered delusional.

The sharpest edge Mr. Trump has over his democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, is his success as a businessman. Donald Trump is a multi-billionaire and is widely famous in the American household as a successful entrepreneur.  His business success could be seen as a precursor to him running an economy successfully. Among all the presidential candidates so far, Mr. Trump’s background is possibly the most scrutinized, and as such he is completely transparent. Despite his shortcomings, Mr. Trump is undeniably very confident and brutally pragmatic- both of which are very good qualities for a president to have.

Time (and chance) will tell how good (or bad) a president Mr. Trump will be if elected. In all probability, he is all bark and no bite. His reign may even not be as terrible as everyone predicts it to be. The overwhelming negative press response to his campaign does drench these hopes, but still, only time will tell.</item>
        <item>The ideology behind introducing Democracy was to give each citizen a bit more power, give them a choice. Now to what extent is this choice given, is not defined by democracy. That’s defined by the implementation of democracy in your respective country.
 
(This is where I will safely assume that all of you believe Brexit was a disaster, and continue building my argument based on that.)
 
The people of the UK did not ask for a referendum. They were given one. A dash of anti EU rage by Brexit lobbyists, a hint of campaigning with misinforming facts, and boom, Brexit was a reality. It’s easy to quietly blame democracy for all of it. Democracy, like any other ideology, has its loopholes, and it is not surprising to see people take advantage of it.
 
Democracy still gave you a choice. In an alternate implementation of democracy, where this referendum fiasco was avoided and a decision was made by ‘elected’ leaders instead, poor little democracy would still be blamed.
 
The United Kingdom primarily chose a poor way of implementing democracy. They gave their people more power than they could digest or understand. And when the referendum was actually underway, it was weird to see how leaders lobbying against Brexit just prayed that the ones lobbying for it weren’t convincing enough. That’s not how it works! If your idea of implementing democracy is to give people a choice, explain only how one side helps, and campaign heavily for it, the flipside isn’t even getting a chance to be discussed about.
 
What most people do not realize is that simple things like right to information can be snatched away from you if democracy ceased to exist. As a citizen, make sure you ask questions, and slowly, if not immediately, you will start asking the right ones. And that’s when you will realize that no one can fool you anymore.
 
A huge chunk of a country’s voting population is the uneducated. It is cake walk to appeal to them emotionally, win them over and get their votes. What we overlook, is that they can be appealed to by both sides, slowly be educated, made sure the internet reaches them, and over time, they will start contributing with smarter choices too.
 
Sometimes, if not always, democracy fails us, and crashes. But herein lies the beauty of it, it can stand again. We know it’s flaws, we can discuss openly about them, maybe over time even eradicate them. Belgium and Lebanon have done it in the past. Of course we will have issues scaling it to bigger and more diverse nations, but hey, I am not here to glorify democracy, I am just here to say it isn’t overrated.
 
I rest my case by writing a tiny open letter to democracy,
 
Democracy,
You are not perfect, you are way far away from perfect, but as time passes, we know you will shape yourself according to our needs as and when needed.
Many a times, you have saved our asses. You make us feel heard. We might hate our governments once in a while, but we certainly don’t fear them, because we know you are there for us.
And together, we will make you stronger. Darling, you are not overrated.</item>
